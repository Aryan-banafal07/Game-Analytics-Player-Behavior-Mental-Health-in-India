# Game-Analytics-Player-Behavior-Mental-Health-in-India

Description
This project explores the relationship between player behavior and mental health in India's gaming community. By analyzing gaming patterns, playtime, and psychological indicators, it aims to provide insights into how gaming impacts mental well-being. The analysis leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to draw correlations, identify behavioral trends, and suggest ways to balance gaming engagement and mental health.

Key highlights:

Objective: Investigate player behavior and its association with mental health.
Approach: Analyze gaming data and survey responses using statistical and machine learning models.
Outcome: Offer insights for game developers, psychologists, and policymakers to promote healthier gaming habits.
Features
Data Collection:

Uses both survey data and in-game statistics to gather information on player behavior.
Parameters include playtime, game genre preferences, social interactions, and mental health indicators.
Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Behavioral Analysis:

Identifies patterns such as addiction risks, social isolation, and stress levels among players.
Machine Learning Models:

Implements algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Clustering for classification and segmentation.
Provides insights into factors contributing to healthy or harmful gaming habits.
Visualization:

Includes interactive visualizations for player behavior trends and mental health correlations.
Performance Evaluation:

Measures model accuracy and interprets behavioral predictions using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and metrics.
Jupyter Notebook: Code development and documentation.

Evaluation
Confusion Matrix: Demonstrates classification performance of machine learning models.
Accuracy Score: Quantifies model precision in predicting mental health outcomes.
Visualizations: Displays trends, correlations, and risk assessments through interactive graphs.
Usage
Data Placement:
Add survey and gaming data files to the data/raw/ directory.
Preprocessing & Analysis:
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
Model Training & Evaluation:
Train the model and evaluate performance using predefined scripts.
Visualization:
Generate visualizations to interpret results.
Troubleshooting
File Format Issues: Ensure datasets are in CSV format with correct encoding.
Missing Data: Verify that data files are placed in the correct directory.
Dependency Issues: Check the Python version and ensure all dependencies are installed.
